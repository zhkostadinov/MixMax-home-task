Bugs found during the tets implementation.


Affected API's:

API url: https://petstore.swagger.io/#/user


1. Update not logged Person username.
2. Field validation.

Test suite covering topic 1 is located here:
    tests/api/update.not.logged.person.spec.ts
        - should response with status code 200 when update person username

Test suite covering topic 2 is located here:
    tests/api/add.person.spec
      
Brakedown topic 1:
   On my opinion, the username should not be changed anyhow. It must be unique for the user.
   The actual behavior is, when we update the username, the service creates a replica of the already existing user with the same ID and other fields. 
   The difference is in the username.
Brakedown topic 2:
   Field validation is missing. We can update phone number to be negative number for example
